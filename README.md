Delphi ARM Backtrace library
============================

This is a repository clone of the Delphi ARM Backtrace library for Delphinus-Support
- original repository https://bitbucket.org/shadow_cs/delphi-arm-backtrace

This is a simple library that allows you to create a stack trace and transform
it into format that can be fed to `addr2line` to convert it to function/line no.
information.

Usage
-----
Add the functions to your project and add compile.bat from sources to your
pre-build events. (Make sure compile.bat can find your NDK.)

Create a back trace by one of the functions from `Posix.Backtrace` and translate
it to symbol addresses using `TPosixProcEntryList`.

Feed the generated lines to `addr2line` to get symbolic function names and line
information. (See `PrintLines.bat` how to do that.)

The result will look like this:

```

```

Known issues
------------
 * There are no unit tests right now as this project is currently in proof of
   concept state.
 * Tested on Android, MacOS, Linux no iOS support right now (patches welcome ;-) ).

TODO
----
iOS support. On iOS we may not need to open /proc/self/maps as there is only one
executable so reading base address from elf might be enough. Returning symbols
and line numbers from XCode is another question.
